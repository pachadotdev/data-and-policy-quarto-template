# Data & Policy Quarto Template

How to use it?

Render `paper.qmd`.

If you need to add a 2nd author, uncomment line 147 in `latex/template.tex`. You
can also add additional authors by copying the line and adapting to `author3`,
`author4`, etc.

The original LaTeX template was downloaded from [Cambridge University Press](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/data-and-policy&ved=2ahUKEwiTm8aIzfqKAxWwvokEHc1INu4QFnoECCIQAw&usg=AOvVaw0w-6b4ZG4tMosf_irxqWVd).
