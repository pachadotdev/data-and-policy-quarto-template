# Introduction

Write your introduction here. This template uses @posit_pbc_quarto_2025.

Consider the following table:

```{r intro1, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

mtcars2 <- mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_mpg = mean(mpg),
    mean_hp = mean(hp)
  )

knitr::kable(mtcars2,
  col.names = c("Cylinders", "Mean MPG", "Mean HP"),
  format.args = list(big.mark = ","),
  caption = "Average miles per gallon and horse power for the mtcars dataset."
)
```

Also consider this image
```{r intro2, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Normal distribution from Wikipedia", fig.align="center", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Normal_Distribution_PDF.png")
```

And this R plot
```{r intro3, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Using ggplot", fig.align="center", out.width="50%"}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatter plot of miles per gallon and horse power",
       x = "Miles per gallon",
       y = "Horse power")
```
